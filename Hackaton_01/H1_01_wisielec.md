## General Information
The hangman game is a game which consists in guessing the correct password (chosen randomly by the program), 

and then a drawing of a hangman is created.


--

- The main problem is that the program does the drawing of a hangman. 
To make it possible, tuples with typical consecutive elements of drawing a hangman were used.


- Another problem is when the program selects a random password. The 'random' library should be imported so that the program can select a random element from the previously prepared range.


- Also pay attention to the repeating letters and their size!
